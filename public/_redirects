# Redirect unknown hex color patterns to universal picker page
# This rule should come AFTER static pages are checked by Next.js
# Pattern: /colors/{hex} where {hex} is 3-6 hex chars but NOT in static generation list
/colors/:hex([0-9a-fA-F]{3,6})  /html-color-picker?hex=:hex  302

# Redirect old color URL structure for backward compatibility
/color/:hex([0-9a-fA-F]{3,6})   /html-color-picker?hex=:hex  302
